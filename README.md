Hello! As someone who enjoys playing starcraft 2 and wanting to add more projects to my portfolio, I made a starcraft unit counter website. As a D3 zerg player, I find that instead of finding micro/macro to be an issue (although it can always be better), I find my unit comps to be the reason I tend to lose games. Therefore, I made a unit counter website which includes 3 main pages:

![starcraft counter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103802577/218232203-8a66dc3d-fc44-400e-a52d-75e062bf26d4.png)

Units List - displays all the units available in SC2 on the ladder
Units Counters - allows the user to choose their enemies race, enemies unit, then their race to be shown the counters to that unit
Unit Comps - allows user to choose their enemies race then their race. Then it shows common army comps and the appropriate counters

Note that I am NOT a professional player so there may be errors in the content.
All the content was sourced from Osiris SC2 Guide, Carbot Animations, Liquidpedia, u/Autodidact420's unit counter chart from reddit, and SC2 client itself.

I am still a novice developer so I probably made many errors and was quite inefficient in this webapp. If you have any feedback, feel free to give me a shout!
